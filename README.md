# HealthTracker
A Health Application that helps you track your sleep, nutrition, and exercise

The main purpose of this project is to re-familiarize myself with the PERN stack (React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL) and git. This is a project I have done before during my sophomore year summer internship at CodePath. This time around I will be personalizing it more, and adding some more cool features. I will also be using TypeScript and Next.js.

This is an application that helps anyone using it to track their sleep, nutrition, exercise activities, and potentially more!
